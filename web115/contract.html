            <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">G. Whitley</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2023 WEB115-N801:
                Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Dr. von Briesen.</p>

            <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites
                will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for
                schoolwork,
                or that I wish to keep private.</p>

            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As
                such,
                failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

            <p>Signed: G Whitley, 20 August, 2023</p>
