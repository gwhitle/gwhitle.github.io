        <h2>Contract</h2>

        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Gina M. Whitley</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
            Fall 2024, WEB250-N801, Database Driven Websites class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>

        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and
            will
            not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

        <p>Signed: <i>Gina M. Whitley, 08/20/2024</i></p>
