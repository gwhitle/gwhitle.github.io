    <p>I, Gina M. Whitley agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2024, WEB215-N801, Adv Markup
        and Scripting class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.

        I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will
        not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
        failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

        Signed: Gina M. Whitley, 01/12/2024
